# A simple tool to download the assets from Gotopazu

 A very simple tool to easily get assets which can then be viewed with [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio), get their newest release from their [releases page](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/releases/latest) and just open the files in there and view them, it's that easy. Just grab the newest release from the [releases](https://github.com/notmynamex/gotopaz-asset-grabber/releases/latest) page!

 Only requirements are:

- Wget on path (download this specific version from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/wget-1.12.1-devel-and-openssl-1.0.0a.zip) and put it in C:\Program Files\GnuWin32. Also here a [short tutorial](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/install-and-use-wget-in-windows-10/) on how to add it to path, just select the "GnuWin32" folder itself instead of the bin folder, since the bin folder doesn't exist.
- Eyes and the ability to remember/copy a version number on the Google Play Store.

and nothing else really, have fun!

To do:

- GUI
- A config file of some sort to config the output directory or something
- Automatically get the newest version
- Alternatively, remember the last entered version and make a GUI button to easily select it
