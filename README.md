# A simple tool to download the assets from Gotopazu
 
 A very simple tool to easily get assets which can then be viewed with [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio), just open the files in there and view them, it's that easy.
 
 Only requirements are:
 - Wget on path (download newest version on [the windows mirror page](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm). Also here a [short tutorial](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/install-and-use-wget-in-windows-10/) on how to add it to path.
- Eyes and the ability to remember/copy a version number on the Google Play Store.

and nothing else really.
I wrote this in like 20 minutes, if there are any issues open an issue.
